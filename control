Package: cvs-fast-export

Description: Export an RCS or CVS history as a fast-import stream.
 This program analyzes a collection of RCS files in a CVS repository
 (or outside of one) and, when possible, emits an equivalent history in
 the form of a fast-import stream.  Not all possible histories can be
 rendered this way; the program tries to emit useful warnings when it
 can't.  The program can also produce a visualization of the resulting
 commit DAG in the DOT format handled by the graphviz suite.  The package
 also includes cvssync, a tool for mirroring masters from remote CVS hosts.
