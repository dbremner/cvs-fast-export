= Reporting bugs in cvs-fast-export =

CVS is a wretched hive of scum and villainy.  Lifting a CVS repository
into a clean revision history is difficult and has rebarbative edge
cases. If you are reading this, you have probably tripped over one
of them.  Here is what to do about it.

== Build and port errors ==

These are relatively simple to fix.  Specify your build environment:
OS, compiler version, and platform.  Include a transcript of the compiler
errors.

== Branch cycle errors ==

Sorry, these are a hard fail.  You may be able to convert with cvs2git.

cvs-fast-export has many advantages over cvs2git. It converts
.cvsignore files, it sanity-checks tag names, it doesn't generate
superfluous TAG.FIXUP branches, it delivers an entire well-formed git
stream that can be fed to git-fast-import directly (rather than two
disconnected chunks that can't) and it is orders of magnitude faster.
If you have a choice between these tools, cvs-fast-export will
almost always do a better and faster job.

Unfortunately, nobody actually understands the core clique-resolution
logic in cvs-fast-export. Yes, even the person who originally wrote it
doesn't. Until that changes, there are some limitations that can't be
fixed.  Whatever causes the "branch cycle error" is the worst of
these.

== Other translation errors ==

=== Reduction ===

First, reduce the test case to a minimal set of CVS files that will
reproduce the misbehavior. The cvsconvert wrapper script should be
useful for getting a concise summary of errors visible at tagged
locations and branches.

There is a tool called 'cvsreduce" in the cvs-fast-export
distribution.  It makes a skeletonized copy of a CVS repository,
dropping out all the content but leaving the metadata in place.
Revision comments are replaced with their MD5 hashes, very short 
but still unique.  

The skeletonization process has the additional benefit of removing any
sort of data that might be sensitive; only filenames, revision dates
and committer IDs are left in place.

A conversion attempt on the skeletonized repo should raise the same
errors as the original did (except for ignorable ones involving CVS
keyword expansion, which will all go away when the file is
skeletonized).  If it does not, try skeletonizing with -t instead
to preserve non-sticky tags

Now try to make the skeletonized repository as small as possible by
removing swathes of files from it, checking each time to make sure the
error continues to reproduce. It is best if you can reduce the fileset
to a single file or pair of files.

You should find you can simplify the directory structure by moving
files from subdirectories to the root, doing file renames to avoid
name collisions. Neither moves nor renames should change the errors
reported except in the obvious way of changing pathnames in the
messages.  Again, if the errors do change in any other way this is
interesting and should be reported.

At the end of this process you should have a handful of skeletonized
master files.  

=== Transmission ===

Make a session transcript showing the error replicating on the reduced
masters. Make a tarball including the reduced masters and the session
transcript.  Mail this to the maintainer with any other information
you think might be relevant.  Better yet, open an issue at the project
home on GitLab and attach this archive.

=== Warning ===

If you don't pass me the ability to reproduce your error, and the fix
isn't instantly obvious, your issue may very well never be fixed at
all.  I didn't write the core of cvs-fast-export, and debugging that
core from the outside without the ability to reproduce errors is not
merely brutally hard but verging on impossible.

=== Compensation ===

Wrestling with CVS repository malformations is ugly, difficult work.

If you are requesting help on behalf of an open-source software
project, you will get help for free as the maintainer's schedule
permits.

The maintainer is available on a consulting basis to all others
and *will* expect to be paid for his pain.
