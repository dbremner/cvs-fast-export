## test for GitLab issue #57

This is the bug description from GitLaab isse #57L:

----------------------------------------------------
The CVS repository contains two files:

parapin-1.0.0.ebuild with revisions 1.1 and 1.1.1.1
metadata.xml with revisions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.1.1.1
After conversion, I see commit 3481164 in the git master branch which doesn't belong there.

Also, commit a01ad40 in the import-1.1.1 branch removes parapin-1.0.0.ebuild but it shouldn't.
----------------------------------------------------

The spurious delete is at mark :5.
The commit that puts branch data on master is mark :7.
